# Memory Game Project

It's a project based on a starter project that display a static version of the Memory Game project that I had to convert into an interactive one.

## How to play

Match all pairs of cards by flipping them in sets of two. If a pair is found, it will stay flipped, else both cards are flipped face down.
Game ends when all pairs are matched.
